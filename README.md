Project name: AI-Powered Recipe Generator

Overview
The Recipe Generator is an AI-based application that creates unique cooking recipes based on user input. Users provide ingredients, and the model generates a complete recipe including the name, ingredients list, and instructions. The goal is to help people cook creatively with what they have on hand.

Features
•	Generate recipes using natural language AI.
•	Input multiple ingredients and get meaningful, coherent recipe suggestions.
•	Built using a pre-trained Transformer model for text generation.
•	Clean and simple web-based UI for user interaction.
•	Structured codebase for easy extension or integration.

Tech Stack
Technology	Purpose
Python	Backend logic and model integration
Transformers	Text generation using pre-trained models
Flask 	Web app backend
HTML/CSS	User Interface

How It Works
1.	User inputs a list of ingredients.
2.	Input is preprocessed and sent to the transformer-based model.
3.	The model generates a recipe, including a dish name, ingredient list, and instructions.
4.	Output is displayed in a user-friendly format on the web or console.


Installation
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/recipe-generator.git
cd recipe-generator
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate 
3. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the app:
python app.py

Use Cases
•	Meal planning
•	Reducing food waste by using leftover ingredients
•	Learning how to cook with unfamiliar ingredient combinations

Future Enhancements
1.	Voice-Based Input: Allow users to speak their ingredients using speech recognition for hands-free usage.
2.	Save & Share Recipes: Allow users to save their favorite recipes or share them directly to social media or via link.
3.	Nutritional Analysis: Integrate a nutrition API to show calorie and nutrient breakdown for the generated recipe.
4.	Add Recipe Images: Use generative AI or curated datasets to display relevant images alongside generated recipes.
5.	Mobile App Version: Create a cross-platform mobile app using Flutter or React Native for wider accessibility.
